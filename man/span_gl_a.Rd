\description{
Performs the subseries-based spanning test for the null hypothesis \eqn{H_0: \alpha = 0} as proposed by
Gungor and Luger (2016). The test assesses whether the intercepts (alphas) of the test assets are
jointly zero, indicating that the benchmark assets fully span the mean returns of the test assets.
}
\details{
This method uses a residual-based Monte Carlo simulation with Least Favorable (LMC) and Balanced (BMC)
configurations to compute robust p-values that account for possible heteroskedasticity,
serial correlation, and fat tails in the return series.

The test is particularly suitable for high-dimensional settings where the number of test assets may be large,
and classical tests (like GRS) suffer from size distortions or loss of power.
The subseries bootstrap procedure accounts for time-dependence and conditional heteroskedasticity,
making the test robust to realistic market dynamics.

The Least Favorable (LMC) p-value provides a conservative inference, while the Balanced (BMC)
p-value may be more powerful but less conservative. The test decision is made based on these values.
