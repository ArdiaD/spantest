\title{Pesaran-Yamagata Test for Cross-Sectional Dependence of Intercepts}
\usage{
span_py(R1, R2)
}
\arguments{
\item{R1}{Numeric matrix of benchmark returns with dimensions (T x K), where T is the number of time observations and K the number of benchmark assets.}

\item{R2}{Numeric matrix of test asset returns with dimensions (T x N), where N is the number of test assets.}
}
\value{
A named list with components:
\describe{
\item{\code{pval}}{P-value of the test under the null hypothesis.}
\item{\code{stat}}{Test statistic value (standardized).}
\item{\code{H0}}{Description of the null hypothesis: \code{"alpha = 0"}.}
}
}
\description{
Implements the Pesaran-Yamagata (2023) test to assess whether intercepts in a multi-factor
spanning regression are jointly zero, while accounting for cross-sectional dependence across assets.
This test is used to check if the benchmark assets' returns span the test assets in terms of expected returns.
}
\details{
The Pesaran-Yamagata test extends classical intercept tests by allowing for cross-sectional
dependence among test assets. It uses residual covariance structure to adjust the test statistic,
improving inference in panels with correlated assets.

The null hypothesis is that all intercepts are zero (\eqn{\alpha = 0}), implying that
the benchmark assets fully explain the expected returns of the test assets.

\examples{
set.seed(123)
# Simulate benchmark and test asset returns
R1 <- matrix(rnorm(300), nrow = 100, ncol = 3)  # Benchmark returns
R2 <- matrix(rnorm(200), nrow = 100, ncol = 2)  # Test asset returns
res <- span_py(R1, R2)
res$pval   # P-value of the test
res$stat   # Test statistic
res$H0     # Null hypothesis being tested

# Interpret result
if (res$pval < 0.05) {
  cat("Reject null: intercepts differ significantly\n")
} else {
  cat("Fail to reject null: no evidence intercepts differ\n")
}
