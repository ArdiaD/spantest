\title{Britten-Jones Tangency Portfolio Spanning Test}
\usage{
span_bj(R1, R2)
}
\arguments{
\item{R1}{Numeric matrix of benchmark asset returns with dimensions (T x N).}

\item{R2}{Numeric matrix of test asset returns with dimensions (T x K).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{pval}}{The p-value under the null hypothesis that the tangency portfolio
is spanned by the benchmark assets.}
\item{\code{stat}}{The F-statistic of the test.}
\item{\code{H0}}{A character string describing the null hypothesis tested: \code{"Tangency portfolio is spanned by benchmark"}.}
}
}
\description{
Implements the test proposed by Britten-Jones (1999), which evaluates whether the tangency portfolio
formed from the combined set of benchmark and test assets is spanned by the benchmark assets alone.
The test uses an F-statistic based on a regression of a constant vector on differences in returns,
reflecting whether the benchmark assets span the Sharpe-optimal portfolio of the full asset universe.
}
\details{
This test is particularly relevant for assessing if the benchmark portfolio captures the maximum
Sharpe ratio achievable when adding new assets.

\examples{
set.seed(321)
R1 <- matrix(rnorm(300), 100, 3)  # Benchmark asset returns
R2 <- matrix(rnorm(200), 100, 2)  # Test asset returns
res <- span_bj(R1, R2)
res$stat   # F-statistic
res$pval   # p-value
res$H0     # Null hypothesis tested
